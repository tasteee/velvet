/* 
  Have a css color variable that you need to derive
  a semi-transparent variant from?

  Well, you COULD convert the hex / rgb / hsl / hsb / whatever
  value to hexa / rgba / hsla / hsba / whatever and store
  that as a new variable, like --pink600-a90.
  
  But no. Fuck that.

  The color-mix() function can help you derive transparent color
  variants without all the manual labor, to which I say... fuck yeah.
